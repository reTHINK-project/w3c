## W3C Community Group: Decentralized Communications

The mission of this group is to specify and build a reference implementation of Decentralized Communications. Decentralized Communications enables natively inter-operable communication services that are able to trustfully use peer to peer connections without having to use central authorities or services. Decentralized Comms are inherently inter-operable without using standard protocols by using the Protocol on-the-fly concept, where the most appropriate protocol stack to be used, is selected and instantiated at run-time.

<!-- 
Don't use "Decentralized Comms". Use a single name.
I think "Decentralized Communications is a very generic name. It leads to confusion. It will never be a top search result in a search engine as there are too many hits, etc.
